Publish for linux-arm from visual studio, because the command in the script doesn't seem to work
Can then put manually on the raspberry pi or transfer it with SCP like in the script, or just run the script
Can then start /home/vip/Software/H3MPIndexServer/linux-arm/H3MPIndexServer
Can do this directly on the pi or by SSH if need to do it remotely
To do it by SSH:
In powershell:
ssh vip@192.168.0.165
Password will be prompted
cd Software/H3MPIndexServer/linux-arm
./H3MPIndexServer -p 7862
